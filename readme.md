# Git Intro

Welcome to the **Git Intro** repository!  
This project is created to practice and understand the fundamentals of **Git** and **GitHub**.

## 📚 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Learn how to initialize a Git repository
- Understand the purpose of staging, committing, and pushing
- Use branches and manage them effectively
- Learn to work with GitHub using SSH
- Practice common Git commands

## 🛠️ What I’ve practiced so far:

- `git init` – Initialize a Git repository
- `git add` – Add files to the staging area
- `git commit` – Commit changes with a message
- `git remote add origin` – Add GitHub as the remote repo
- `git push` – Push changes to GitHub
- `git branch` – Work with branches
- `git merge` – Merge changes from one branch to another

## 🔐 SSH Setup

This project also includes practice with setting up **SSH authentication** for secure GitHub access:
- Generated SSH keys
- Added public key to GitHub
- Tested SSH connection

## 📁 Project Structure

This is a simple project with basic files to test Git operations, including:
- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `README.md`

## 🚀 Future Plans

- Collaborate using Git with others
- Handle merge conflicts
- Explore GitHub features like Issues and Pull Requests
